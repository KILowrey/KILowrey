# About Me

## My name is Kira, but online and at camp I usually go by Bismuth

I'm a full stack web dev student. My main interests are accessability and databases. I have a lot of fun creating folders and files, coding servers, and creating routes. I prefer using tools created by people with passion rather than corperations. I love writing my own notes inside books to condense knowledge. I'm also, like, *really* good at tangents.
